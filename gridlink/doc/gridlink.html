<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Gridlink is a tool for manipulating the rectangular link diagrams
which were introduced as variant forms of arc presentations in
<p>
<cite>
Peter R. Cromwell, "Embedding knots and links in an open book I:
Basic properties," <i>Topology Appl.</i> <b>64</b> (1995), 37--58. 
</cite>
</p>
These diagrams were later used by Ivan Dynnikov in his paper:
</p>
<p>
<cite>
Ivan Dynnikov, "Arc-presentations of links. Monotonic simplification,"
<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/math.GT/0208153.pdf">
arXiv:math.GT/0208153</a>.
</cite>
</p>
<p>
Dynnikov proved in the paper above that any rectangular diagram of an
unknot or split link can be <strong>monotonically</strong> reduced to a trivial
diagram by a sequence of elementary moves.  Thus this gives a recognition
algorithm for grid diagrams of the unknot.
</p>

<p>
More recently (Fall 2006) these diagrams have been used to give a
combinatorial description of the knot and link Floer homology.

A rectangular link diagram (or gridlink) is a polygonal link
projection consisting of horizontal and vertical line segments lying
in the integer grid, such that whenever two segments cross, the
vertical segment is the overcrossing.  The diagram is also required to
be in standard position, in the sense that no two segments are
colinear.
</p>

<p> Following Cromwell, Dynnikov defines three elementary moves on a
rectangular diagram: the castling, or exchange move; the cyclic
permutation, and the destabilization move.  The castling move is an
isotopy which drags one vertical (horizontal) segment across an
adjacent one, interchanging the x (y) coordinates of the two segments,
and fixes all segments which do not meet the two that are being
interchanged.  (Because it is an isotopy, a castling move can only be
performed when the projections of boundary 0-spheres of the two
segments are unlinked.)  The cyclic permutation move is an isotopy in
which the horizontal (vertical) segment at the top or bottom (left or
right) is moved under (over) the diagram to the opposite side.  The
simplest destabilization move removes a pair of consecutive segments
of length 1.  However, the boundary of a segment of length 1 can never
be linked.  So there is a more general destabilization move that
removes any segment of length 1; this is the destabilization
implemented by the program.  There are four types of
stabilization/destabilization moves, and the user can restrict which
these types will be allowed.  <br> </p>

<a name="start"></a>
<h3>Starting and stopping</h3>
<p> After completing the installation, the program can be run from the
command line by just typing <code> gridlink </code>.  It is also
possible to run it by typing <code> python gridlink.py </code> from
the directory containing the files gridlink.py and gridlink_data.py.
</p>
<p>
Double click the figure 8 icon to start up the Macintosh or Windows
standalone applications.
</p>

<p>
If you want to have access to the internal objects you can also load
gridlink as a python module from the python interpreter with the
command:
<br>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;   import * from gridlink</code><br>
For this to work, make sure that your python interpreter can find the
two files gridlink.py and gridlink_data.py.  This can be done by
starting the python interpreter from the directory containing the
files, or by putting them in a directory that is specified in your
PYTHONPATH variable, or by putting them in the python site-packages
directory.
</p>

<p>When the program starts, a small "app window" with an image of the
figure 8 knot opens. Each link will open in a new window, and these
windows will be tracked in the "Windows" menu. The app window disappears
as soon as a link is opened. If all of the link windows are closed the
app window will reappear. Closing the app window stops the program,
as does the "File-&gt;Exit" menu.
</p>

<a name="moves"></a>
<h3>Moves</h3>
<p>
Inside a link window, when two segments are highlighted in blue,
click the mouse to exchange.  Click and drag the mouse on the
background to do cyclic permutation.  Gridlinks are oriented, and the
orientation is displayed with an arrow head on each vertical segment.
(They can also be displayed as a matrix of dots, or X's and O's.) The
orientation of a component can be reversed by clicking the "reverse"
button and then selecting the component with the mouse.  The "reflect"
botton rotates the diagram by 90 degrees; due to the crossing convention
this is equivalent to reversing all crossings.  The buttons
labelled "NE", "NW" "SE", "SW" select one of the four types of
stabilization moves.  (The checkboxes under these buttons can be used
to limit which types of stabilizations/destabilizations are allowed.)
After clicking a stabilization button, select a segment to be
stabilized.  If a vertical segment is selected, the move takes place
at the tail of the segment.  To perform a move at the head of a
vertical segment, select the following horizontal segment.  In this
case, the stabilization move is equivalent to stabilizing at the tail
of the vertical segment and then transporting the new length 1 segment
to the head by exchange moves.  To destabilize, click the "destab"
button and select a length 1 segment to remove.  </p>

<p>
There are shortcut keys for all operations except for stabilization:
d to destabilize, r to reverse, f to reflect, u to undo, and arrow keys for
cyclic permutations.
</p>

<p>
The program records all moves, and the list can be displayed by
running the "print_moves" method at the python prompt.  The number of
moves is displayed at the lower right corner of the gridlink window.
The "Moves-&gt;Reset" menu action clears the list of saved moves and
restarts the counter.  The "Moves-&gt;Review" menu action allows you to
step forward or backward through your sequence of moves, displaying
the projection at each step.  The "Moves-&gt; Simplify" menu action
applies a random sequence of 10000 (unrecorded) elementary moves,
performing (allowed) destabilizations when possible.  In most cases
this will reduce the presentation to something close to minimal.  If
not, try again.
</p>

<p>
Note that the simplification process does not perform any stabilizations.
In contrast with Dynnikov's result for projections of the trivial knot,
it is not always possible to reduce a projection of a non-trivial knot
to minimal arc index without stabilizing.  In fact, Lenny Ng pointed
out to us that the the (2,3) cable of the (2,3) torus knot has a grid
projection which cannot be minimized without stabilization.  He
provided the following XO-description of this projection:
<pre>
X = {1,0,7,14,13,3,2,8,15,5,4,10,9,16,6,12,11}
O = {10,9,16,0,6,12,11,1,7,14,13,3,2,8,15,5,4}
</pre>
This example is discussed in the appendix to
<cite>W. Menasco, "An addendum on iterated torus knots"
<a href="http://arxiv.org/math.GT/0610566.pdf">
arXiv:math.GT/0610566</a>.
</cite>
</p>

<a name="menus"></a>
<h3>Menus</h3>

<p>
The "File" menu allows a projection to be saved, loaded, printed or created.  
Save or load a projection together with a list of
moves with "File-&gt;Save as ...", or "File-&gt;Open".  Write a
Postscript rendering of the link with "File-&gt;Snapshot ...".
The "File-&gt;New" menu is used to create a projection, as described below.
The "File-&gt;Exit" menu terminates the program.
</p>
<p>
The "View" menu gives several options for the graphical represention of
the projection and display of addition data about the projection, such
as winding numbers, Thurston-Bennequin number and rotation number.
</p>
<p>
The "Moves" menu allows the user to step backwords and forwards through
the sequence of saved moves.
</p>
<p>
The "Invariants" menu allows computation of the Heegaard Floer
Homology groups with mod 2 coefficents (for knots).  Gridlink has an
embedded version of the
<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~wgillam/hfk/"> software</a>
written by John A. Baldwin and W. D. Gillam.
</p>
<p> The "Windows" menu keeps track of all link projection windows
that are open.
</p>

<a name="entering"></a>
<h3>Entering a link</h3>
<p>
A link can be entered as a closed braid from the menu
File-&gt;New-&gt;ClosedBraid.  A dialog box will ask for the number of
strands and a word in the braid group.  For example, the word
1,1,-2,1,3,-2,3,4,-3,4 describes a 5 strand braid representation of
knot 9_12.  
</p>
<p>
The program also contains a table of closed braid representions of
knots up to 12 crossings, generated from a query of Chuck Livingston's
knotinfo database: http://www.indiana.edu/~knotinfo/ To load a knot
from this table use the File-&gt;New-&gt;Knot menu.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the menu File-&gt;New-&gt;XO link allows entry of a gridlink as
a matrix containing exactly one X and one O in each row and column.
The link is constructed as a vertical segment from the X to the O in
each column, and a horizontal segment from the O to the X in each
row.  Enter the link by listing the row indices of the X's and
the row indices of the O's. NOTE: rows are numbered from bottom to top,
columns from left to right. Indices begin at 0.
