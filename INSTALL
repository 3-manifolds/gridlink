UNIX users:
* download gridlink.tgz to a temporary location (e.g. /tmp)
* change to the temporary directory (cd /tmp)
* unpack the archive. (tar xfvz gridlink.tgz)
* change to the new subdirectory named Gridlink_pkg (cd Gridlink_pkg)

IF YOU ARE A SUPERUSER and would like to install gridlink for
use by all users, type:
   sudo python setup.py install
or su as root and type
   python setup.py install

IF YOU ARE NOT A SUPERUSER and want to install gridlink in your home
directory, type:
   python setup.py install --home ~
This will install the executable script in the directory ~/bin and
the other files will be installed in ~/lib/python .
For this to work conveniently, you will need the directory ~/bin to
be included in your environment variable PATH, and you will need
~/lib/python to be included in your environment variable PYTHON_PATH. 
You can arrange this by typing the two commands below or, to have it
done automatically, by adding the commands to the appropriate startup
file (e.g. ~/.profile or ~/.cshrc):

(for the bash shell)
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
export PYTHON_PATH=~/lib/python:$PYTHON_PATH

(for the csh or tcsh shell)
setenv PATH "~/bin:$PATH"
setenv PYTHON_PATH "~/lib/python:$PYTHON_PATH"

MAC users:

Download the disk image named Gridlink.dmg .  Attach the disk image
and copy the application into your Applications folder (or wherever
else you might want it to go).  Double click the figure 8 icon to
run the program.  To uninstall, drag the application to the trash.

WINDOWS users:

If you have python installed on your system you may be able to follow
the UNIX instructions from a DOS prompt.  Maybe there will be a
standalone Windows application at some point.
